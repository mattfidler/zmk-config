## Notes about this repository

This is my zmk repository for my chocofi keyboard.  It was first taken
from
[beekeeb](https://github.com/beekeeb/zmk-config-corne-chocofi-with-niceview)
since that is where the board was from.

However, I also found some excellent zmk configuration options in the
configuration from [urob](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config) was
quite helpful for home row modifications.
